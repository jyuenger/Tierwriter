A tiered, typewriter-style handwired 60% mechanical keyboard with arrows and UK ISO support

Things you'll need:
- A controller ([Stampy RP2040](https://keeb.io/products/stampy-rp2040-usb-c-controller-board-for-handwiring)) and firmware (UF2 files in the Firmware folder)
- Five custom 1.5mm thick switchplates, one for each row (AI files for lasercutting in the Plate folder)
- Two stepped support wedges (STL file for 3D printing in the STL folder)
- Ten M3 8mm screws
- Ten M3 threaded inserts to heat-set into the holes in the support wedges (four more if you want to install threaded inserts into the holes on the underside of the wedges, intended for mounting the whole assembly into a future baseplate or case)
- An MX keycap set with the following nonstandard keys - 1.5u R2 backspace, 1.5u R3 Enter
- 70 MX switches
- 70 1N4148 diodes
- Optional: 70 [1u Amoeba PCBs](https://keeb.io/products/amoeba-single-switch-pcbs)
- One clip-in plate mounted 7u stabilizer for the spacebar
- Insulated wire for connecting the key matrix to the controller (see matrix/pin diagram in the Miscellaneous folder)
- Solder and soldering iron (for wiring, and for heat-setting the threaded inserts into the support wedges)


TO DO:
- Write build guide
- Port firmware to VIAL
- Design decorative/protective exterior casing
- Modify row 5 plate to accommodate an 8u spacebar
