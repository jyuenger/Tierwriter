A tiered, typewriter-style, handwired 60% mechanical keyboard with arrows, 7u/8u spacebar, dual MX/Alps support, and modified ISO

## BUILD GUIDE AND PROTOTYPE PHOTOS COMING SEPTEMBER 2023

## Things You'll Need:
- A controller ([Stampy RP2040](https://keeb.io/products/stampy-rp2040-usb-c-controller-board-for-handwiring)) and firmware (UF2 files in the Firmware/QMK and Firmware/VIAL folders)
- Five custom 1.5mm thick switchplates, one for each row (AI files for lasercutting in the Plate folder; Alps/MX combo version is in the Alps subfolder)
- Two stepped support wedges (STL file for 3D printing in the STL folder)
- Ten M3 8mm screws (four more if you want to screw the undersides of the wedges the optional base plate, plus three more if you want to install the optional rear wall)
- Ten M3 threaded inserts to heat-set into the holes in the support wedges (four more if you want to screw the undersides of the wedges the optional base plate, plus three more if you want to install the rear wall)
- An MX or Alps keycap set with the following ***nonstandard keys***: 1.5u R2 backspace, 1.5u R3 Enter. Plus a 7U or 8U spacebar, and any extra 1u R4 key you'd like to use as Caps Lock
- 70 MX or Alps switches
- 70 1N4148 diodes
- Insulated wire for connecting the key matrix to the controller (see matrix/pin diagram in the Miscellaneous folder)
- Solder and soldering iron (for wiring, and for heat-setting the threaded inserts into the support wedges)
- One clip-in plate mounted 7u or 8u stabilizer for the spacebar ([8U stabilizers available at SPRiT](https://www.spritdesigns.com/product-page/stabilizers))
- Optional: 70 [1u Amoeba PCBs](https://keeb.io/products/amoeba-single-switch-pcbs)
- Optional: Five decorative top plates, one for each row (AI files for lasercutting in the Plates folder; will fit MX or Alps build)
- Optional: Base plate (AI file for lasercutting in the Plate/Bottom Plate folder)
- Optional: Rear wall (STL file for 3D printing in the STL folder)
